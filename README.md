# Overview
This project is meant to gain familiarity with C in preperation for working on a microcontroller project while I wait for all the parts to arrive. I will be building a calculator interpreter as I feel this is a good exercise in data structures, it will require a loop with allocated memory that I will need to free, and this is something I could see actually existing at the bottom of a larger program written in C.

## Goals
* **Dynamic Memory Management** - Demonstrate proper dynamic memory allocation in C by using sizeof() with malloc() or calloc() in at least two distinct instances within the program
* **Native C Practicality** - Deliver a fully functioning program that showcases the advantages of C (low-level memory, performance advantages) with clear rationale for using C instead of higher-level alternatives.
* **Complex Data Structure** - Design and integrate at least one non-trivial data structure (e.g., binary expression tree or hash table) to parse, store, or evaluate expressions within the program.
* **Memory Cleanup** - Deliberately structure a memory allocation scenario in a loop where failure to free() would lead to a leak, and implement and verify correct deallocation.
